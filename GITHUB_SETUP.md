# GitHub Setup Summary

This document summarizes the GitHub repository setup and CI/CD configuration for the Gmail Exporter project.

## Repository Setup

The Gmail Exporter project has been configured for GitHub at: `https://github.com/octasoft-ltd/gmail-exporter.git`

## Files Created/Updated

### GitHub Actions Workflows

1. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Continuous Integration
   - Runs on push to `main` and `develop` branches
   - Runs on pull requests to `main`
   - Jobs: test, lint, build, security scan
   - Builds for multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows - AMD64 and ARM64)
   - Uploads build artifacts

2. **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** - Automated Releases
   - Triggers on version tags (v*)
   - Runs tests and builds binaries for all platforms
   - Creates GitHub releases with:
     - Changelog generation
     - Binary attachments
     - SHA256 checksums
     - Installation instructions
     - Documentation links

### GitHub Templates

3. **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`** - Bug report template
4. **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`** - Feature request template
5. **`.github/pull_request_template.md`** - Pull request template

### Build Configuration

6. **`.gitignore`** - Comprehensive ignore file excluding:
   - Credentials and authentication files (*.json)
   - Export directories and files
   - Build artifacts and binaries
   - Temporary files and logs
   - IDE and OS files

7. **`.golangci.yml`** - Linting configuration
8. **`Makefile`** - Build automation with targets for:
   - Building (single and multi-platform)
   - Testing with coverage
   - Linting and security scanning
   - Development setup
   - Release preparation

## CI/CD Features

### Continuous Integration
- **Testing**: Runs all 67 test functions with race detection
- **Linting**: golangci-lint with comprehensive rules
- **Security**: gosec security scanner
- **Coverage**: Codecov integration
- **Multi-platform builds**: Linux, macOS, Windows (AMD64/ARM64)

### Automated Releases
- **Version management**: Uses Git tags for versioning
- **Binary distribution**: Automated builds for all platforms
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated release notes
- **Security**: SHA256 checksums for verification

## Security Considerations

### File Exclusions
The `.gitignore` file ensures no sensitive data is committed:
- All JSON files (credentials, tokens, configs)
- Export directories and email files
- Metrics and log files
- Build artifacts

### CI/CD Security
- No secrets required for public builds
- Security scanning in CI pipeline
- Dependency verification
- Vulnerability checking

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/octasoft-ltd/gmail-exporter.git
   cd gmail-exporter
   ```

2. **Development setup:**
   ```bash
   make dev-setup
   ```

3. **Build and test:**
   ```bash
   make all
   ```

4. **Run security checks:**
   ```bash
   make security
   make vuln-check
   ```

### For Releases

1. **Create a release:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **The GitHub Actions will automatically:**
   - Run all tests
   - Build binaries for all platforms
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Upload binaries and checksums

### For Users

Users can download pre-built binaries from the GitHub releases page or build from source using the provided Makefile.

## Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Create first release:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Monitor CI/CD:**
   - Check GitHub Actions for successful builds
   - Verify release creation
   - Test binary downloads

## Maintenance

- **Dependencies**: Regularly update Go dependencies
- **Security**: Monitor security advisories
- **CI/CD**: Keep GitHub Actions up to date
- **Documentation**: Update as features are added

The repository is now ready for production use with professional CI/CD, comprehensive testing, and automated releases.
